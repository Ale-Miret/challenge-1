# Module 1 HTML, CSS, and Git Challenge

## Description
As a bootcamp student, I want my code to be accessible and easy to read. To accomplish this, I made a couple of changes to both my html and my css, all the while ensuring that the changes I make in one does not create a conflict in the other. These changes make the code easier to understand and eliminates redundancies, this accomplishes the goal of creating a user friendly and accessbile webpage. Below are some of the changes/additions I made.

* Added comments to html and css sheets
* Added alt attributes to all images
* Replaced all divs with navs, ensuring the html is following a semantic structure
* Eliminated unecessary classes and added ids in instances where those could be used instead of a class
* Added  header tag to html 
* Added footer tag to html
* Organized both css and html by grouping like items 
* Organized headers so that they fall in sequential order
